## The following are some problems relating to simple logical deduction.
### (a) If $A$ is elected, then $B$ will resign. If $C$ is elected, then $B$ will not resign. However, if $A$ is elected, then $C$ will not be elected. Therefore $B$ will resign. Is the argument valid.

No, this argument is not valid.

Set $P$ : $C$ is elected, $Q$ : $B$ will resign.

We have $P \rightarrow \neg Q$, but we can't get any infomation from $\neg P$.

In this case, $B$ must resign if $A$ is elected.
